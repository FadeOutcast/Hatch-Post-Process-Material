**Please note: The models used in these images were not designed by me and are not available in this repository. They are only used to display the post process material.**

The post process material is fully customizable, giving you full control on different aspects like the hash texture used, the hash and primary colors, and the hash texture tiling. Just create a material instance (or use the one already provided in this repository). Below is an image showing all the parameters that can be changed.

The last image uses the scene base colors instead of one primary color. Here is a video of the post process material in action (please note that due to compression the video may not be as clear as ingame):
